    "- **area:**<br> At first, specify the area for which you want to sub-set the SEAS5 dataset. This is important as otherwise you would download the global data, which is very large. Refer to syntax of CDS API, refer to https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/seasonal-original-single-levels?tab=form and submit exemplary request.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **form:** <br>Then you need to specify the dataformat, can be either \"grib\" or \"netcdf\". Grib is more difficult to work with but __[Felix](https://github.com/jamaa)__ managed to get it to work with https://github.com/ecmwf/cfgrib and https://github.com/sydroconsult/eccodes-build-windows.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **grid**:<br>This is an important setting. SEAS5 data is by default provided interpolated to a regular 1°x1° grid. The original data however is computed on finer grids (model physics on 0320 and dynamics on T319, refer tp __[SEAS5 user guide](https://www.ecmwf.int/sites/default/files/elibrary/2021/81237-seas5-user-guide_1.pdf)__. Whilst data could be provided on the original grids, e.g. O320, it is still not clear to me if that is then actually the original data or if it was interpolated from another grid the data was stored on.<br>\n",
    "<br>\n",
    "- **system:** <br>You need to be careful about the system, read here: https://confluence.ecmwf.int/display/CKB/Announcements. For operational use and hindcast it should be set to the new system, i.e. 5.1 (set to \"51\"). At the time of writing (10.01.2023) however not all start months for the hindcast period of the new system 5.1 were already uploaded to Copernicus Data Store (CDS). Therefore I downloaded the data for system 5 instead.<br>\n",
